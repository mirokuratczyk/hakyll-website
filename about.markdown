title: About
---

I am a Software Engineer who currently resides in The Annex in Toronto. Now that I have finished my degree I spend most of my time drinking coffee, coding and working on music.

I spent a good deal of 2012 to 2015 self-teaching myself how to mix and produce audio. This consisted of a good few thousand hours spent between reading books, forums and hands-on practice (many, many 8+ hour mixing sessions). I will post the names of my favourite mixing books when I find the time. I am also a *self-taught* (read: subpar)
guitarist and have amassed what I consider a *half*-decent home studio. I am the proud owner of a *Sequential Circuits Pro One*. Yes, the j-wire version.

In the cooler months I find myself playing squash and running at UofT's Athletic Centre. In the warmer months I spend time cycling and skateboarding. I completed the Lake to Lake twice when it was still being held. Hopefully someone will rise to the challenge of running this event again as it was one of the most scenic races in Ontario.

I also like to [read](/books.html).

You can find my academic and work related info. in my [resume](/images/resume.pdf).
